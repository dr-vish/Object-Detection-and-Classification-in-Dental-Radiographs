Object Detection and Classification in Dental Radiographs

Developed a machine learning model using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Logistic Regression to detect and classify healthy vs diseased teeth in dental images.
Preprocessed and augmented the data, trained the model, and optimized hyperparameters using grid search and cross-validation.
